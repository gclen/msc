Dipole_Matrix_Element
=====================

Used to calculate the transition dipole moment vector between two cube files. That is the matrix element <a|r|b> where a and b are the wavefunctions of the initial and final states respectively. The transition dipole moment is a vector and is output in its cartesian components. In addition the norm is also output. In both cases the quantities are in atomic units. When using this code one should make sure that the cube files are generated on the same grid. This is to ensure that the distance function works correctly.
